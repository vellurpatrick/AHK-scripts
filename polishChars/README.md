# polishChars

A script for more natural polish diacritics writing in case of having no right Alt key (for example, when using US-type keyboard).
The character can be written by pressing right Ctrl and a corresponding normal character. Adding Shift will result in uppercase.

Example:
RCtrl + a = ¹
RCtrl + x = Ÿ
Shift + RCtrl + z = ¯

It also disables possibility of changing keyboard design to "QWERTZ" by Shift + RCtrl combination. However it is still possible to switch beetwen "QWERTY" and "QWERTZ" by using Shift + LCtrl.
